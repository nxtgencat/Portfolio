## üõ†Ô∏è Database Management

The backbone of the placement portal is a **PostgreSQL database** hosted on Supabase. Here's how the database is structured and managed:

- **Role-Based Data Segmentation**: Separate tables for users, students, recruiters, jobs, and colleges ensure clean and organized data storage.
- **Relational Design**: All entities, such as students, jobs, and applications, are connected through foreign keys, enabling seamless queries and updates.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Supabase provides real-time updates, allowing instant reflection of any changes across all user dashboards.
- **JSON Support**: Complex data, such as application details and job requirements, are stored in JSON columns for flexibility and easier parsing.
- **Security and Access Control**: Role-based access ensures that each user type (admin, student, recruiter, college) can only access and modify relevant data.
- **Activity Logs**: Tracks all user actions, like posting jobs or submitting applications, to maintain transparency and audit trails.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Automated backups ensure data integrity and allow quick recovery in case of issues.
